# **Lighting up Boulder Reefs: Influence of fluorescent substrates on biofluorescent chiton distribution**

# **Abstract**

# **1. Introduction**

An organism is intrinsically integrated with its environment [@maturana1987]. It is continuously immersed in physical and chemical proprieties, which we can observe as *cues*[^1], *signals*, and *informations* used to establish ecological relationships and adapt to a changing world [@ dusenbery1992; @stevens2013; @delhey2017]. These processes are primarily mediated by the sensory system, which defines the boundaries of the organism's *sensory environments* [@krapp2008] and, ultimately, the boundaries of their *ecological niche* [@jaeger1978]. The sensory environment influences individual fitness in various ways, affecting the search for feeding, shelter, mates, and migrations [@kingsford2002; @yamamoto2023; @escalona2023; @cooper2023]. *Boulder dwellers* are notably influenced by their capacity to utilize sensory cues in assessing *habitat quality* during larval settlement and spatial distribution (Evans 1951, Sil√©n and Jansson 1972, Svane and Dolmer 1995, Sumner-Rooney et al. 2020). A boulder is a rounded rock fragment, regularly or irregularly shaped, greater than 256 mm [@wentworth1922], and notably prone to rolling when subjected to physical disturbance [@sousa1979]. These disturbance can include wave action [@sousa1979a], currents and storms [@li2023], or human activities like seafood harvesting [@stagnol2013]. The rate at which boulder overturns depends on factors such size, mass, shape, burial, orientation, and location [@mcguinness1987a; @lorang2000; @goto2010; @gomez-pazo2021]. Additionally, boulders frequently experience microscale disturbance from wave-borne projectiles (e.g. logs, driftwood, pebbles, cobbles and even other boulders) and sand abrasion [@daly1977; @shanks1986]. As a result, boulder reefs are highly dynamic, patchy, and unstable marine systems, forming a mosaic of patches at various stages of community development [@osman1977; @sousa1984; @mcguinnes1986]. At a finer-scale, factors like resource availability, reproductive needs, competition,predation risk, and disturbance regime may act as filters, favoring behaviors that allow individuals to select high-quality habitats for survival and reproduction [@majoris2018; @kimirei2013; @hyman2024]. In patchy landscapes, habitat specialists species can potentially choose to occupy habitats that maximize their fitness [@price2010; @@rimmer2021]. At broader scales, these patterns of *habitat use* defines crucial areas for the population's long-term survival and reproduction, leading to spatial-temporal heterogeneity observed at the community level [@rosenzweig1987; @deangelis2014; @leibold2018]. 

Many shallow-water marine organisms are sensitive to light in at least one phase of their life cycle [@cronin2017; @marshall2017c]. Light plays a central role in numerous biological processes, including biological rhythms, photosynthesis, photoperiodism, phototaxis, and vision [@bjorn2015; @bhadra2017; @brelsford2019]. Ecologically, light influences energy flow within ecosystems, affecting productivity, species distribution, and ecological interactions [@floder2002; @cohen2002; @thrane2014]. It also acts as a selective pressure, driving evolutionary changes in behaviors, physiology, and morphology, such as pigmentation [@lahti2016], photoreception and the development of optical structures [@nilsson2013; @randel2016]. In this way, light has profoundly shaped the evolutionary history of life on Earth [@rapf2016; @beckstead2016]. The interaction of light and matter determines its availability and how effectively it can be utilized by living organisms. For instance, the amount of sunlight that reaches the forest floor is ifluenced by factors like sun position, leaf area per unit ground area and optical properties of both the leaves and the soil [@bolibok2013]. Similarly, the quality of light reaching visual pigments depends on the *optical properties* of  pre-retinal media (i.e. the cornea, lens, and aqueous and vitreous humors), as  well as specialized structures such as oil droplets and *tapeta* [@cronin2014]. The diversity of color patterns in nature arises from contrasting optical proprieties of pigments, structural mechanisms, or *bioluminescence* [@cuthill2017; @schramm2024], often serving as visual signals for mate selection [@kato2024], camouflage [@cuthill2019], aposematism [@caro2019], or as visual cues for sheltering [@costa2023], foraging [@spaethe2001], and conspecifics recognition [@silva2024]. Fluorescent pigments, i.e. fluorophores, have gained particular attention due to the incresing number of documented biofluorescent animals, including sponges [@read1968; @mazel2003b], corals [@eyal2015], hydrozoans [@maggioni2020], siphonophores [@haddock2015], planarians [@stubenhaus2016], worms [@mazel2003b], seasnails [@williams2016], nudibranchs [@betti2021a], barnacles [@matsumura2014], crabs [@juhasz-dora2024], stomatopds [@mazel2004], tardigrades [@suma2020], spiders[@lim2007; @brandt2017], fish [@anthes2016; @sparks2014], frogs [@@taboada2017a], salamanders [@lambs2020a], turtles [gruber2015a], geckos [@protzel2021], birds [@arnold2002; @wilkinson2019], and mammals [@olsson2021; @anich2021]. Fluorescence is a physical phenomenon in which emitted light typically has lower energy (i.e., longer wavelength) than absorbed light due to to energy conversion into other forms [@johnsen2011]. Although fluorophores cannot add more energy to the system, they can add more photons, potentially enhancing the brightness of an organism's surface [@mazel2004; @montgomerie2006]. The visual role of biofluorescence in eco-evolutionary processes remains a topic of debate [@iriel2010; @marshall2017; @mazel2017]. Some studies suggesting that it may enhance the intensity of visual signals, potentially influencing mate choice [@arnold2002; @mazel2004; @lim2007] and the settlement of planktonic larvae in marine benthic organisms [@matsumura2014]. 

Red algae are easily recognized by their reddish hue, which primarily results from accessory pigments knows as phycobilins [@lee2018]. These phycobiliproteins are highly fluorescent components of light-harvesting photosynthetic antenna complexes [@glazer1994]. Studies on larval settlement have show that the optical properties of substrates play a important role in the recruitment of photosensitive larvae from numerous benthic invertebrates species [REF]. Evidence suggests that red-colored substrates and substrate brightness positively influence habitat selection of planktonic larvae [satheesh2010; @mason2011; @ells2016]. In boulder habitats, red crust algae typically groth around the edge of boulders (Liversage 2016), serving as both food source and settlement substrate [Steneck 1982, Littler et al. 1995, Figueiredo et al. 1997, Roberts et al. 2010, Ritson-Williams et al. 2014). Chitons species, in particular, are closely associated with these algae, relying on coralline crustose as a primary food source and larval settling surface (Barnes and Gonor 1973, Rumrill and Cameron 1983, Piercy 1987, Camus et al. 2012). These multi-shelled marine mollusks have a remarkable sinsitivity to light and function as a cohesive sensory unit (Crozier and Arey 1918; Arey and Crozier 1919; Boyle 1972; Crozier 1920; Liu et al. 2022). Their shells are equipped with a range of sensory receptor, and some species even possess specialized 'shell eyes' capable of images formation and polarization vision (Speiser et al. 2011; Li et al. 2015; Chappell and Speiser 2023). Boulder chitons species can fully utilize the three-dimentional structure of their boulder habitat (Liversage and Benkendorff 2017), influenced by both tidal and non-tidal rhythms, including the light-dark cycle, tidal regime, seasonal changes, weather, temperature fluctuations, habitat features, food avaiability, and species interactions (Glynn 1970, Kangas and Shepherd 1984, Yoshioka and Fujitani 2006, Ng and Williams 2006). These factors lead to variations in behavior across species and habitats [@cretchley1997]. Boulder chitons often resting underneath boulders in daylight and crawling on the vertical sides at dawn or nightime [@larger1978]. During this time, they use their iron-mineralized radula to scrape food from substrates, ingesting a variety of organisms and sediment particles (Fulton 1975; Joester and Brooker 2016). Research on the spatial distribution of boulder chiton species has largely focused on the upper and lower surfaces of boulders, overlooking the sides (Evans 1951, Kangas and Shepherd 1984, Smith and Otway 1997, Grayson and Chapman 2004, McClintock et al. 2007, Chapman 2012, Liversage and Benkendorff 2017). The chiton *Ischnoplax pectinata* (G. B. Sowerby II, 1840) is an ecologically understudied species that exhibits fluorescence on its shell (Grimaldi et al. 2023). This has led to the hypothesis that individuals may be more commonly found in boulders with higher fluorescent coverage along the sides, which could provide both a food source and a visual *background* for camouflage against visually guided predators. 

In this study, we investigate whether the cverage of fluorescent substrates, specifically crustose red algae, on the  sides of boulders influences the spatial distribution of the biofluorescent chiton *I. pectinata*. Our hypotheses are: 1) boulders with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate coverage on their side surfaces will have a greater abundance of chitons, and 2) this relationship is not influenced by a species-specific effect of the crustose red algae. 

# **2. Material and Methods**

## *Study site*

Our research was conducted in four intertidal reefs, arranged from north to south: Pitangui (05¬∞37‚ÄôS 35¬∞13‚ÄôW), Santa Rita (05¬∞41‚ÄôS 35¬∞11‚ÄôW), B√∫zios (06¬∞00‚ÄôS 35¬∞06‚ÄôW), and Ba√≠a Formosa (06¬∞22‚ÄôS 34¬∞59‚ÄôW). These reefs are situated along approximately 90 km of the eastern coast of Rio Grande do Norte, on the northeast coast of Brazil (Figure 1). The region experienced a tropical humid climate, with annual precipitation reaching up to 1500mm, mainly occurring during the austral spring [@vital2016]. The dry season runs from October to December, while the rainy season lasts from February to September [@diniz2015]. During the dry season, sea temperature averages 28 ¬± 0.01¬∞C (mean¬±SD), with salinity of 35 ¬± 0.02. While, in the rainy season, these values drop to 27 ¬± 0.03¬∞C and 34 ¬± 0.06 respectively [@hazin2008]. Winds come predominantly from the southeast [@silva2002] with a mean speed ranging between 3.7 m/s (April) and 5.1 m/s (October) [@barros2013a]. Tides follow a semi-diurnal pattern with a meso-tidal regime [@vital2016]. The beaches are primarily composed of siliciclastic sands, consisting mainly of moderately sorted fine to medium-grained quartz, with carbonate sediments observed as biodetrical gravel [@vital2009]. Small rivers contribute to reduced fluvial discharge and depositing coarse silt sediments (‚Äòmuddy‚Äô) primarily at their mouths [@vital2016].

## *Field Methods/ Data Collection*

Our sampling was carried out during low tide between April and May 2021, encompassing a total of 120 boulders (30 boulders per reef). Before sampling, we conducted a preliminary search at each reef to locate the presence of the chiton species *I. pectinata* in the sampling area. Once identified, we randomly selected a direction using a digital stopwatch [@gotelli2012] to determine North (odd/odd), East (odd/even), South (even/even), or West (even/odd). We then walked (15 steps) in the chosen direction and selected the nearest accessible boulder that could be overturned without being buried or trapped [@palmer2012]. Using the stopwatch again, we decided whether to sample the boulder or not. If the decision was negative or if we left the sampling area, we repeated the process. There was no restriction on the weight of the boulders, as long as they could be overturned and moved [@palmer2012]. At each boulder, we recorded the abundance of attached chitons of *I. pectinata* ("*Chitons*"), water temperature ("*Temp*"), tide level in relation to the base of the boulder ("*Wt.level*"), and weight ("*Weight*"). Additionally, we take photographs from all sides of the boulder with a scale for subsequent analysis of the exposed (*i.e.* surface not covered by the macroalgae canopy) lateral substrate cover. Each boulder was weighed in a cloth bag using a handheld scale. These measurements were performed as the final step to minimize any potential impact on chiton abundance [@sigwart2019]. All boulders were georeferenced and it was treated as an independent unit of habitat [@palmer2012]. After sampling, each boulder was returned to its original position and orientation.

Images were analyzed using the PhotoQuad software [@trygonis2012]. After the image calibration, we manually defined a region of interest (ROI) for each side of the boulder to determine the exposed side surface area ("*Expo.area*"). Within each ROI, we spawned 70 stratified random points (*marker*: circle, *size*: 10, *width*: 2) to determine the percentage of substrate coverage. The points were marked according to the following coverage categories: fluorescent substrates ("*Flu.cover*"), consisting of living Crustose Coralline Algae (*Lithothamnium* sp., "*Live.cca*") and soft red crust algae ("*Peyssonnelia*" sp., "*Live.pey*"); unfluorescent substrates ("*Unflu.cover*"), composed by dead red crusts ("*Dead.red.crust*"), bare rock, and microbial mats; and animals, *i.e.*, ascidians ("*Asc.cover*"), bryozoans ("*Bryo.cover*"), cnidarians ("*Cnid.cover*"), polycheats ("*Poly.cover*"), and[^2] sponges ("*Spong.cover*"). Holes and unidentifiable substrates were categorized as "*Others*". 

## *Statistical Analysis*

We first conducted a data exploration analysis (Supplementary Material A) followed the protocol described in Zuur *et al.* (2010). 
One-way data comparisons across different reefs were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (hereafter as KW test), followed by Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction. We Kendall‚Äôs tau coefficient to assess variable correlations. To avoid collinearity, we calculated Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), excluded the variable "*Unflu.cover*" to ensure VIF values remained below 2 [@zuur2010]. For model building, we opted for a top-down strategy [@west2022]. We fitted a 'loaded' mean structure model, excluding cnidarians, polychaets, and mollusks variables because their average coverage was less than 1%.  Furthermore, we tested whether incorporating a random effect structure improve the model and then reduced it by removing non-significant fixed effects (Supplementary Material B).

Akaike's information criterion corrected for small samples (AICc) was used to rank alternative (nested) models, with a decrease in ŒîAICc of ‚â•1 considered a substantial improvement [@burnham2002]. Akaike weights, ranging from 0 to 1, were computed for each model, with higher values indicating more plausible models. We apply the likelihood ratio test via ANOVA with correction for testing on the boundary to compare these (nested) models [@zuur2009]. Following model selection, scaled residuals were computed, visually inspected for deviations from uniformity, and evaluated using fit tests on the simulated residuals with the '*DHARMa*' package [@hartig2022]. To investigate whether the abundance of fluorescent chitons is influenced by the fluorescent substrate ("*Flu.cover*") on the sides of the boulders, we performs a Poisson generalized linear mixed model with zero inflation (ziGLMM Poisson) and square root transformation to the predictor for a better fit. To assess whether the effect of fluorescent substrate coverage can be translated into a species-specific association with the type of red crust algae on the boulders, we constructed a new model using the predictors "*Live.cca*" and "*Live.pey*" separately. Our final best-fit model was a Negative Binomial generalized linear mixed model with zero inflation (ziGLMM Negative Binomial). All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (R Development Core Team 2024), fitting the GLMM models with the ‚ÄúglmmTMB‚Äù package [@brooks2017].

# **3. Results**

## *General characterization and comparison among reefs*

A total of 137 chitons were recorded, with adults comprising 95.6% of the regional population, while young chitons accounted for a proportion of 1/20. At the time of sampling, only 8 individuals were found in activity on the side of the boulders. Overall, 36.6% of the boulders were occupied by chitons, with an encounter rate of approximately 09 chitons per hour. At the reef scale, B√∫zios exhibited a significantly higher abundance compared to other locations (p<0.01, KW test), with an average density of 3.60 chitons per boulder (Table 1). At the habitat scale, the boulder exhibited consistent weights (p=0.53, KW test) and estimated areas (p=0.70, KW test) across the different reefs. They had an average weight of 7.0 $\pm$ 6.3 kg ($\overline{x}\pm SD$), with a minimum of 1.5 kg and a maximum of 25 kg, and an estimated surface area was 267 $\pm$ 144 cm^2^, ranging from 75 cm^2^ to 830 cm^2^. On the other hand, water levels shows significant variations (p<0.01, KW test), ranging from a minimum of 11.2 $\pm$ 6.3 cm in Santa Rita to a maximum of 76.8 $\pm$ 28.7 cm in B√∫zios. Consequently, differences in water temperature (30.7 $\pm$ 1.5 ¬∞C) were also observed across reefs (p<0.01, KW test), with Pitangui shosing the lowest average values (28.9 $\pm$ 0.9 ¬∞C) and Santa Rita the highest (32.3 $\pm$ 0.8 ¬∞C). 
 
On the boulder's side, the averaged exposed side surface area was 222 $\pm$ 121 cm^2^, ranging from 60.78 cm^2^ to 698.36 cm^2^. There were no significant variations between reefs (p=0.44, Kruskal-Wallis test). This exposed side was composed of 54.11 $\pm$ 20.19% fluorescent substrates, 31.83$\pm$18.29% unfluorescent substrates, 12.10 $\pm$ 12.07% animals, and 1.96 $\pm$ 2.45% other components. Fluorescent substrates
included live crustose coralline algae (*Lithothamnium* sp.), which averaged 47.52 $\pm$ 21.39%, and red soft crust algae (*Peyssonnelia* sp.), which averaged 6.59 $\pm$ 12.50%. Red crusts algae were present on the side faces of all sampling boulders, with similar percentages between Ba√≠a Formosa (61.19 $\pm$ 19.50%) and B√∫zios (67.17 $\pm$ 12.93%). Despite their small coverage, red soft crusts were present on 66% of the side faces of the boulders. In short, we found variations in the coverage of fluorescent substrates (p<0.01, KW test), crustose coralline algae (p<0.01, KW test), and red soft crust algae (p<0.01, KW test). Unfluorescent substrates, which included dead red crust (13.63 $\pm$ 10.11%), "bare rock" surfaces and microbial mets (**falta calcular e inserir no Supp A**), also varied among reefs (p<0.01, KW test). Animal coverage primarily consisted of ascidians (5.79 $\pm$ 7.78%), sponges (2.83 $\pm$ 4.85%), and bryozoans (1.54 $\pm$ 4.14%). Among these, only bryozoans showed consistent coverage across different reefs (p=0.27, KW test). Cnidarians, polycheats, and mollusks together accounted for 1.95 $\pm$ 6.65% ($\overline{x}\pm SD$).

## *Chitons abundance increases with fluorescent and bryozoans covers*

Our analysis show that the abundance of fluorescent chitons significantly increases with higher percentages of fluorescent substrates and bryozoan coverage on the sides of the boulders, regardless of the reef scale (FIGURE OU TABLE?). Specifically, chiton abundance increases at a rate of 0.02 chitons per percentage of fluorescent substrates (ziGLMM Poisson, z=3.11, SE=0.01, p<0.01) and approximately 0.20 chitons per square root of bryozoan coverage (ziGLMM Poisson, z=1.96, SE=0.11, p<0.05)[^3]. When examined through a species-specific relationship between chitons and red crusts, chiton abundance becomes proportionally linear to the increase of bryozoans, at a rate of 0.05 chitons/bryozoan cover (GLMM Negative Binomial, z=2.28, SE=0.02, p=0.02). In this context, the live cover of neither CCA nor soft red crusts significantly predicted an increased likelihood of the data's occurrence in our model (tabela modelos).

# **4. Discussion**

Boulder reefs are typically characterized by habitat specialist species, which are patchily distributed throughout the reef landscape [@chapman1996;@smith1997;@chapman2002a]. Habitat specialist species often exhibit aggregated spatial distributions at the scale of individual boulders, with large numbers occupying a few boulders while many others remain unoccupied [@chapman2002; @grayson2004; @smoothey2007; @palmer2012]. Ecological studies in this habitat have predominantly focused on the lower and/or upper surfaces of boulder habitats, often neglecting the sides [@kangas1984;@chapman2005;@liversage2012; @liversage2015]. However, mobile species can spatially utilize boulder habitats in a three dimensional way [@evans1951;@wells1980]. Boulder chitons, for example, are frequently found beneath boulders, emerging at specific times to feed on the sides [@liversage2017a]. The west Atlantic species *Ischinoplax pectinata* exhibits fluorescence in its shell, leading us to assume that individuals would be more associated with habitats with greater coverage of fluorescent substrate, particularly along the side of boulder [^4] [@grimaldi2023]. Fluorescent substrates on boulders are primarily composed of encrusting red algae, which contain highly fluorescent pigments known as phycobiliproteins [@glazer1994]. So, these algae could serve both as a food source and potentially provide a visual background effect against visual guided predators [@sigwart2017;@sigwart2018]. Using ecological modeling, our study demonstrates that the abundance of this fluorescence chiton species increases with a higher percentage of fluorescent substrate and bryozoan cover on the boulder side, revealing a non-species-specific algae role in the chiton-red algal crust association.


Our model fits best when considering the combined effect of red crusts algae as fluorescent substrates, rather than focusing on specific species, with and without interacting structure. This suggest that visual aspects of habitat may be important in determining the spatial distribution of adults chitons. Chitons are organisms highly sensitive to light [@li2015]. Like many animals with planktonic larvae, their sensitivity likely shifts ontogenetically [@marshall1999]. For example, the boulder chiton species *Ischnochiton magdallensis* has larvae that are positively phototropic, while the adults exhibit negative phototropism (@heath1899 in @arey1919). Theses typically occurs because the visual requirements of the planktonic larvae differ significantly from those of the adult niche, often necessitating substantial optical reorganization [@cronin2014]. Sensorially, the individual niche of an organism is circumscribe by multimodal sensory limits [@stevens2013]. This is especially relevant in biofouling studies, where the physico-chemical interactions for larval settlement need to be completely understood for the development and potential applications of non-toxic, inexpensive, and low or zero environmental impact antifouling systems on benthic communities. Although many studies deal with just one modality at time, e.g. chemical cues, visual cues can also be important, specially on a finer scale, in determining larval settlement [@ambrose2021]. Fluorescence can enhance the intensity of a surface through a low-energy-cost physical process [@johnsen2011], attracting positively photosensitive larvae [@matsumura2014]. Chiton larvae (i.e. trochophores) developed eyes with 3-day-old (@sirenko2018). Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that larvae seeming to actively choose to settle on bryozoan colonies [@creese1986] or crustose coralline algae [@barnes1973; @rumrill1983]. Crustose coralline algae constitute the primary food source for many chitons species [@kangas1984; @sigwart2017], with studies indicating mutual benefits arising from the chiton-red algae association [@steneck1982a; @littler1995]. Differential larval dispersion can result in aggregated spatial distributions patterns among chitons, which may explain why chitons inhabiting the same boulder are not genetically releated [@palmer2012]. However,as a mobile species, adult chitons are not confined to their larval settling sites and can migrate between boulders [@liversage2017a]. Therefore, the increased abundance of *I. pectinata* associated with greater fluorescent coverage on the side of boulder may be linked to other factors, such avoidance visual predators by visual camouflage [@mendonca2016; @sigwart2018; @grimaldi2023].

Bryozoan cover emerged as a important predictor foor chiton abundance, consistently proving to be a significant factor in the models. Although bryozoans cover a smaller percentage of the boulder side compared to other elements, chiton abundance increases proportionally to the square root of bryozoan coverage. In other words, when bryozoan cover quadruples, the chiton abundance doubles. Bryozoans are a dietary component of many chiton species, even if only in small quantities [@gordon1972; @lidgard2008; @byrnes2009;@sigwart2017]. They likely also constitute part of the diet of *I. pectinata*, playing a crucial role in its ecology. An indirect approach as studying the stomach/gut contents across different seasons and life stages could provide evidences to support this hypothesis. Additionally, a morphological study of bryozoan colonies can also offer clues, as certain species developing defensive spines under predation pressure [@harvell1998]. However, chitons may not be feeding on the bryozoans themselves but rather on the associated copepods, amphipods or hydroids [@osman1981; @lidgard2008]. Like many other mollusks, chitons feed with a beltlike, muscularized strap bearing rows of teeh mineralized with iron oxides, know as the radula [@joester2016]. Herbivorous chitons use their radula to scrape algae off rock (or tear pieces of macroalgae), often leaving scars on hard surfaces such as crustose coralline algae or rocks[@littler1995]. Thus, although chiton species exhibit a variety of feeding habits (even xilophagous, @duperron2013; @sigwart2017), their gut contents often include a diverse array of items, including rock fragments, sand, and detritus [@langer1983; @demopulos1975; @fulton1975; @glynn1970; @barnawell1960]. This unintentional ingestion, known as "bulldozing", may obscure the role of bryozoans as a food source to *I. pectinata* when compared to more voluminous elements in stomach contents, such calcareous algae.

Many organisms exhibit biofluorescence, including sponges [@read1968], cnidarians [@mazel1995; @maggioni2020], mollusks [@betti2021a], spiders [@brandt2017], fish [@michiels2008], amphibians [@taboada2017a;@lamb2020a], reptiles [@gruber2015a; @protzel2021], birds [@arnold2002; @pearn2003], and mammals [@kohler2019; @olson2021a]. Additionally, a variety of fluorescent proteins have been  identified in both plants and animals [@goodwin1953; @alieva2008]. Their presence in the tissues and exoskeletons seems to serve diverse functions related to the biology, ecology and evolution of species [?]. These hypothetical functions include photoprotection [@salih2000], photosynthesis improvement [@dove2001], host interaction [@aihara2019], pollinator/ prey attraction [@gandia-herrero2005; @kurup2013; @haddock2015], mate choice [@arnold2002; @lim2007], communication [@mazel2004; @gerlach2014a], and camouflage [@sparks2014a; @gruber2016a]. Although many of them are controversial [@pearn2001; @mazel2003a, @iriel2010; @mazel2017]. The origin of biofluorescence in *I. pectinata* remains unknown. It is possible that it results from the direct or accidental ingestion of red crusts algae (*Lithothamnium* sp. and *Peyssonnelia* sp.), which are rich in phycobiliproteins, know for their high fluorescence [@glazer1994]. A previous study showed that as individuals of  *I. pectinata* grow, the fluorescence area on their shell decreases [@grimaldi2023]. If the fluorescence of the species is due to its feeding habit, then changes in diet during different life stages might be occurring [@camus2012]. Our data suggest a possible differentiation in the habitat use between phases, with few juveniles being found sharing boulders with adults. Perhaps the species exhibits an ontogenetic niche shift as a necessary condition for reproduction or predator avoidance [@sanchez-hernandez2019], with juveniles being more frequently found in other habitats of the reef ecosystem, e.g. rhodolith beds (Pers. Observation). A long-term population demographic study could reveal potential ecological trade-off throughout both ontogeny and season [@kimirei2013]. 


According to IPPC Sixth Assessment Report, it is almost certain ("*high confidence* scenario") that seawater pH has decreased globally over the past 40 years, signifying a major process of ocean acidification [@ipcc2023]. This is associated with $CO_2$ uptake, which changes the chemistry of seawater and reduces the saturation state of calcium carbonate,a crucial component of the skeletons and shells of a variety of marine organisms [@jones2017; @osborne2020]. Biomineralized organims living on boulder reefs may respond differently to ocean acidification. For instance, crustose coralline algae are particularly vulnerable [@kamenos2016], while *Peyssonnelia* sp. (and even bryozoans, @swezey2017) may exhibit adaptive response to acidification [@linares2015]. Chiton valves have also be showed to be resistant to acidification [@sigwart2014;@sigwart2015;@pebbles2019]. In fact, the chiton lineage has survived major changes throughout Earth's history [@sigwart2014]. However, the effects of global change also encompass temperature shifts, which together may caused hypoxia of coastal habitats [@melzner2013] and food aviability [@thomsen2013]. In intertidal ecosystems, inceasing storm frequency is anticipated to alter coastal hydrodynamics [@ipcc2023]. These changes may modify the disturbance regine in boulder reefs systems, especially those caused by physical damage such as wave action, sand abrasion, and collisions with human-made debris and between boulders. This plethora of interacting factors produces varied spatiotemporal effects at different ecological scales, directly impacting the lives of individuals. However, do these changes affect fluorescence? Understanding how such chages might influence the detection and perception of organisms and their subsequent effect on ecological interactions, requires further investigation.

Boulder reefs are high complex, unstable and meta-dynamic habitats*[^5]. Understanding the dynamics of ecological relationships that are established in these environments is crucial for a better understanding of future scenarios of global change. In this study, we investigated a biofluorescent chiton species and its relationship with substrate coverage on the sides of its boulder habitats. We find a direct relationship between its abundance and the coverage of fluorescent substrates and bryozoans. This highlights the importance of examining the side of boulders in the ecological studies of boulder chitons. Addicionally, we explore the possibility that the chiton-red crust algae association might extend beyond a purely trophic relationship, involving visual aspects enhanced by fluorescence.
